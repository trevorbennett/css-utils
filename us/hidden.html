<h1>Welcome to spooky hidden page</h1>
<h3>this is for my personal reference notes, since I'm a luddite who wants to own stuff but is comfortable relying on security through obscurity that could be defeated by both random guessing, and looking at a github project</h2>

<h4>Podcast thoughts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Our quality is pretty good compared to most actually. We need a heavier focus on marketing</li>
  <li>Swear less, it sounds pretty bad when you do swear all the time, even for Reason Podcast</li>
  <li>make sure to chat with the audience and with Eric. Keep the tone conversational</li>
  <li>when marketing, think of myself as the consumer, think of what it would take to convince me.</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Personal motivation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Don't ever say I can't or I must. The reality is typically that I won't or I will</li>
  <li>Ignore my circle of concerns outer edges. Shrink it. Work within my circle of influence, and grow it</li>
  <li>Never forget: my first real act of high level self control and discipline started with picking up weights. The same is true of many people who turned their lives around</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>History shows, time and time again, over more than 3 years, that reddit is my ultimate opiate. I need to avoid it like the plague, and purposely neuter it's addictiveness.</li>
</ul>
