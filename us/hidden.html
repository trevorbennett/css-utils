<h3>this is for my personal reference notes, since I'm a luddite who wants to own stuff but is comfortable relying on security through obscurity that could be defeated by both random guessing, and looking at a github project</h2>

<h4>Podcast thoughts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Our quality is pretty good compared to most actually. We need a heavier focus on marketing</li>
  <li>Swear less, it sounds pretty bad when you do swear all the time, even for Reason Podcast</li>
  <li>make sure to chat with the audience and with Eric. Keep the tone conversational</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Personal motivation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Don't ever say I can't or I must. The reality is typically that I won't or I will</li>
  <li>Ignore my circle of concerns outer edges. Shrink it. Work within mycircle of influence, and grow it</li>
</ul>
